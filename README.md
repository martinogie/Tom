 Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) have enabled the detection and classification of brain tumors in previous years however this method remains labour-intensive, time- consuming and subjective. Deep learning Convolutional Neural Networks have proved to be very effective in processing large datasets in little time with high accuracy based on learned features.

In this project, we propose an architecture MarNet, which is a U-based deep CNN model, a variant of the popular U-Net model widely used for image segmentation tasks. The model takes in greyscale images and through some representation learning, extracts features from the tumor images and learns to classify the images into pituitary, meningioma, and glioma classes. This model gave an accurate prediction of about 94% accuracy on test data while also reducing false positives across each class. This model is packaged as a web application AI assistant called Dr. Tom and deployed on AWS. Its job is to take MRI images and predict with high accuracy, if there is tumor and the type of tumor present.

This project has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. The accuracy and efficiency of MarNet make it a valuable tool for radiologists and neurosurgeons, enabling them to make more accurate diagnoses and develop more effective treatment plans. The use of deep learning models like MarNet has the potential to revolutionize medical imaging and improve patient outcomes.
